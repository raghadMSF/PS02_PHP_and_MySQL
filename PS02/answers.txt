Q1: Why inserting a prevously insterted value in name will generate an error ?
A1: Because we have setted the constraints of the table to have a unique NAME column and therefore will generate an error since insterting a previous value already exists.

Q2: Why for phone we have used varchar and for mobile we have used char ?
